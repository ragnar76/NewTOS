//! A28 — **the state reset at the desktop → child-program boundary.**
//!
//! The desktop runs in the kernel boot context (`RUN` null) and reports AES
//! id **0**, as does the first program it launches in GEMDOS slot 0 — the
//! whole application chain is EmuTOS's one `rlr`, pid 0
//! (`docs/api/aes/application.md` § "AES process identity and pid",
//! contract (b), A56). Desktop and first child therefore report the same AES
//! id. Until A62 they also shared one AES process descriptor; since A62 the
//! descriptor is keyed by the identity (the GEMDOS slot, or the desktop's
//! own reserved index — contract (a)). **The sharing was never
//! the defect** — EmuTOS does the same thing, renaming the one `rlr` for each
//! successive program (`references/emutos/aes/gemshlib.c:633-636`). This test
//! runs its "child" in the boot context too (no `RUN`), so phases 1–2 act on
//! the desktop's descriptor; phase 3's flag reset on a slot-keyed descriptor
//! is covered by `aes_pd_by_slot.rs` (c).
//!
//! The defect is that EmuTOS resets that shared descriptor **twice** on the way
//! across the boundary and NewTOS did neither:
//!
//! 1. `desk/deskmain.c:2159-2166` — the desktop's epilog, run before the next
//!    program is loaded: `menu_bar(NULL,0)`, `wind_set(DESKWH, WF_NEWDESK,
//!    NULL,0,0)`, **`appl_exit()`**. `appl_exit` is `ap_exit`
//!    (`aes/gemaplib.c:251-261`), which **drains the message queue**
//!    (`if (rlr->p_qindex) ap_rdwr(MU_MESAG, rlr, rlr->p_qindex, …)`) and clears
//!    `AP_OPEN`.
//! 2. `aes/gemshlib.c:636` — `sh_ldapp`, immediately after `p_nameit` /
//!    `p_setappdir` and before `dos_exec`: **`rlr->p_flags = 0;`**. It does
//!    *not* touch the queue; the queue is the first reset's job.
//!
//! What this file asserts is the **effect**, not the code site:
//!
//! * **phase 1** — the queue is empty *before* the child's `appl_init` runs, so
//!   the child starts with zero inherited messages;
//! * **phase 2** — the control: `appl_init` itself does **not** erase anything
//!   (EmuTOS `ap_init`, `aes/gemaplib.c:54-63`, only ORs `AP_OPEN` — A25). So
//!   phase 1's zero cannot be explained by `appl_init`; only the boundary can
//!   explain it;
//! * **phase 3** — the flag reset, through its one observable consumer: the
//!   launcher's "the program called `appl_init` without `appl_exit`" cleanup
//!   (`aes/gemshlib.c:650-657`, `close_client_if_open`) must judge **the program
//!   that just ran**, not a flag the previous occupant of the descriptor left
//!   behind. A console program (`.NCP`) never calls `appl_init`, so that cleanup
//!   must not fire — and must not throw away the desktop's own pending messages.
//!
//! All three phases live in one `#[test]`: the AES descriptor table and window
//! table are process-wide statics, so two test functions in one binary would
//! race.
//!
//! Harness shape (backend + host + parameter block) follows
//! `aes_app_return_descriptor.rs`; this file needs no pixels, so the backend is
//! a silent sink.
