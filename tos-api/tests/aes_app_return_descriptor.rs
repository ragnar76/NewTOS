//! A29 — **what the desktop loses when a program returns.**
//!
//! The desktop runs in the kernel boot context (`RUN` null) and reports AES
//! id **0**; so does the first program it launches, in GEMDOS slot 0, and so
//! does every `Pexec` child — the whole application chain is EmuTOS's one
//! `rlr`, pid 0 (`docs/api/aes/application.md` § "AES process identity and
//! pid", contract (b), A56; `aes/geminit.c:850-877`). Desktop and first child
//! therefore **report the same AES id**. Until A62 they also shared one AES
//! process descriptor; since A62 the descriptor is keyed by the *identity*
//! (the GEMDOS slot, or the desktop's own reserved index — contract (a)),
//! and only the reported number is shared. This test runs its "child" in the boot context too (no `RUN`), so
//! it exercises the desktop's descriptor across the boundary; the slot-keyed
//! child is `aes_pd_by_slot.rs`'s business. The sharing of the *number* is
//! EmuTOS-faithful: `sh_ldapp` renames the very same `rlr` for the program it
//! is about to start (`references/emutos/aes/gemshlib.c:633-636`).
//!
//! What EmuTOS does to that shared descriptor when the program ends is the
//! point of this file. Both of its end-of-program paths keep the descriptor
//! alive and clear exactly two things:
//!
//! * the application's own `appl_exit` — `ap_exit`
//!   (`references/emutos/aes/gemaplib.c:251-261`): drain the queue
//!   (`if (rlr->p_qindex) ap_rdwr(MU_MESAG, …)`), then
//!   `rlr->p_flags &= ~AP_OPEN`. `p_pid` and `p_name` survive;
//! * the launcher's fallback for a program that never called `appl_exit` —
//!   `sh_ldapp` (`references/emutos/aes/gemshlib.c:650-657`): `mn_cleanup()`,
//!   the same queue drain, the same `p_flags &= ~AP_OPEN`.
//!
//! Neither frees the `AESPD`. In EmuTOS it *cannot* be freed — the descriptors
//! are fixed entries of `D.g_int[]`/`D.g_acc[]` reached by index (`pd_index`,
//! `aes/gempd.c:32-35`), and `fpdnm(NULL, pid)` (`:38-57`) walks that array
//! with no liveness test at all, so a message addressed to a pid always finds
//! its descriptor.
//!
//! The test drives the real launch boundary through the LP64 AES dispatcher,
//! in the order `kernel/src/desk/main.rs` (`run_gem_app` → `desktop_relinquish`
//! / `desktop_resume`) and `kernel/src/launch.rs` execute it, and then asks the
//! only question that matters: **after the program is gone, does the desktop
//! still get its messages?**
//!
//! Harness shape (backend + host + parameter block) follows
//! `aes_window_content.rs`; this file needs no pixels, so the backend is a
//! silent sink.
