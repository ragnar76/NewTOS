//! `wind_get(WF_SCREEN)` hands out the AES menu/alert screen buffer — address
//! and length, as two native LONGs over `int_out[1..4]`, TRUE.
//!
//! EmuTOS answers field 17 out of `gsx_mret`: `gsx_mret((LONG *)poutwds,
//! (LONG *)(poutwds + 2))` with `poutwds = &int_out[1]`
//! (`references/emutos/aes/gemwmlib.c:1563-1565`, `aes/gemsuper.c:343`;
//! `gsx_mret` `aes/gemgsxif.c:125-129`, pinned tree
//! `1a7484aba1bfba23e2c0899e243b6d8177fe41df`) — `*(LONG *)&int_out[1] =
//! gl_tmp.fd_addr; *(LONG *)&int_out[3] = gl_mlen;` — and returns TRUE
//! (`:1595-1598`), on any handle (`:1517-1520`). The buffer is taken **once**
//! at AES start by `gsx_malloc` (`:108-114`, from `sh_tographic`,
//! `aes/gemshlib.c:236`); the 1.4 ROM on the reference TT reported address
//! `0x01000218`, length `40960` (`measurement-2026-09-12-aes-r4/`, cases 331,
//! 332 and 439 of `tosdump/cases/aes-r4-subfunctions.tsv`, CRC `227422B2`).
//!
//! NewTOS has the buffer since A57 (`tos_api::aes::gsxif`, design
//! `docs/analysis/a57-aes-screen-buffer-design-2026-09-20.md`); this binary
//! runs it through the harness fixture (`aes_reference/harness.rs`,
//! `install_screen_buffer`) because a host process has no BDOS pool. A57
//! **turned this file round**: until then it pinned the A54 answer, FALSE with
//! nothing written, the honest reply while there was no buffer.
//!
//! # What the reference decides, and what the formula decides
//!
//! The r4 table itself declares `WF_SCREEN` a **device parameter** —
//! "RECORDED, not compared away" (`aes-r4-subfunctions.tsv`, "WHAT IS DEVICE
//! DEPENDENT"): the address is wherever that machine's pool put the block and
//! the length is `gsx_mcalc` of that machine's screen. So, as the VDI suite
//! does for its plane-dependent words (`vdi_reference/harness.rs`,
//! `MACHINE_EXCLUDED` + `substitute`), the two LONGs are checked here **by
//! EmuTOS' rule evaluated on this workstation** rather than against the TT's
//! numbers:
//!
//! * `int_out[0]` — the sub-function question, device-free: **1**, as the TT
//!   recorded for 331/332/439 (and for round-1 case 166, which the reference
//!   harness now compares directly);
//! * `int_out[1..2]` — the buffer's address: the fixture's
//!   [`SCREEN_BUFFER_PA`] (an EL1 caller gets the physical/pool address,
//!   ADR-021; the TT's `0x01000218` is that machine's), **the same on every
//!   call**;
//! * `int_out[3..4]` — the length: NewTOS' `gsx_mcalc`, one screen in device
//!   pixels, `bb_save_words(W, H) * 4` = 614 400 at 640×480 (the TT's 40 960
//!   is `MENU_BUFFER_SIZE * 8 * 16 * 4 / 8` at four planes — the named
//!   deviation in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`, A57).
//!
//! Tickets: `TASK/A57.md` (closes the A54 remainder), `TASK/A54.md`.
