//! AES Resource Manager (`rsrc_*`, opcodes 110–114) — Batch 1.
//!
//! Spec: [`docs/api/aes/resource-fileselector.md`]. **NewTOS uses a native
//! resource format** (decision 2026-06-21): the on-disk `.RSC` stores our
//! own 64-bit `OBJECT` layout, little-endian, with internal pointers held
//! as **byte offsets from the blob base**. Loading is therefore a pure
//! offset→pointer relocation — no endianness swap and no 16→64-bit
//! expansion (unlike a classic Atari `.RSC`). The OBJECT coordinates are
//! the classic file's **packed char-grid words** (from NRSC v9/v10 on) and
//! are turned into pixels **at load**, per object, with the live
//! `gl_wchar`/`gl_hchar`/`gl_width` — EmuTOS's `rs_fixit` → `fix_objects`
//! → `rs_obfix` (`gemrslib.c:816-820`, `:606-637`, `:89-99`), see
//! [`fix_objects_coords`] and [`rs_obfix`]. `rsrc_obfix` (114) is the same
//! `rs_obfix`, applied by an application to an object of its own.
//!
//! Native `.RSC` layout (all little-endian). Seven header generations
//! coexist; the loader picks by `version` and is backward-compatible:
//!
//! * **v1 (LP64) / v2 (ILP32)** — 28-byte header, no free-string/free-image
//!   tables. GEM.RSC / DESK.RSC and any pre-D-054 resource. R_FRSTR / R_STRING
//!   / R_FRIMG / R_IMAGEDATA report the documented "not found" (there is no
//!   table), so these files keep loading unchanged.
//! * **v3 (LP64) / v4 (ILP32)** — 44-byte header that additionally carries a
//!   **free-string** and a **free-image** pointer table, so `rsrc_gaddr`'s
//!   `R_FRSTR`/`R_STRING`/`R_FRIMG`/`R_IMAGEDATA` selectors resolve (D-054).
//! * **v5 (LP64) / v6 (ILP32)** — 68-byte header that additionally carries the
//!   **TEDINFO / ICONBLK / BITBLK** array bases + counts, so the remaining
//!   `rsrc_gaddr`/`rsrc_saddr` selectors (`R_TEDINFO`/`R_ICONBLK`/`R_BITBLK`
//!   and the `R_OBSPEC`/`R_TEP*`/`R_IBP*`/`R_BIPDATA` sub-pointer aliases)
//!   resolve to real struct/field addresses (AUD-P6-002). Those three counts
//!   are also what the **relocation** walks: EmuTOS `rs_readit` fixes the
//!   sub-structure pointers array-wise, by `rsh_nted`/`rsh_nib`/`rsh_nbb`
//!   (`gemrslib.c:798-805`), so a record no object references is a pointer
//!   afterwards too. A pre-v5 blob declares no such arrays; it still loads if
//!   it holds no text/icon/image object, and is refused if it does, because
//!   its records could not be relocated (A36).
//! * **v7 (LP64) / v8 (ILP32)** — the same 68-byte header, but the **tree
//!   index** is a relocatable pointer table instead of a `[u32]` of root
//!   OBJECT indices: caller-pointer-wide slots holding a root's byte offset,
//!   rebased on load like the frstr/frimg tables. That is EmuTOS's
//!   `rsh_trindex` array, the one `fix_trindex` publishes through
//!   `AESGLOBAL.ap_ptree` (`gemrslib.c:591-603`) and `get_addr(R_TREE, i)`
//!   reads back (`:124`) — so `rsrc_load` finally has an array to name (A35).
//!   A v1–v6 blob keeps loading and keeps answering `rsrc_gaddr(R_TREE, i)`
//!   from the index form; it simply publishes no `ap_ptree`.
//! * **v9 (LP64) / v10 (ILP32)** — the same 68-byte header, but the OBJECT
//!   coordinates are the classic file's **packed char-grid words** (char
//!   count in the low byte, signed pixel offset in the high byte) instead
//!   of pixels: the loader runs `rs_obfix` over every object at load with
//!   the live `gl_wchar`/`gl_hchar`/`gl_width` (EmuTOS `fix_objects`,
//!   `gemrslib.c:606-637`), so the layout follows the machine the file is
//!   loaded on, not the one the converter assumed (A40). A v1–v8 blob holds
//!   pixels and is not converted — the tool of its day did that with
//!   `8 × 16 / 640` baked in.
//! * **v11 (LP64) / v12 (ILP32)** — an 84-byte header that additionally
//!   carries the **CICONBLK / CICON** array bases + counts of a new-format
//!   (colour-icon) `.rsc` (A41, spec §5). The records are the application's
//!   C structs (`CICONBLK { ICONBLK monoblk; CICON *mainlist; }`, `CICON {
//!   num_planes; col_data; col_mask; sel_data; sel_mask; next_res; }`,
//!   `obdefs.h:203-217`) with blob offsets in every pointer field, and a
//!   `G_CICON` object's `ob_spec` is the byte offset of its CICONBLK — so the
//!   relocation is the generic one. After it the loader runs EmuTOS's
//!   `fix_cicons` (`gemrslib.c:549-573`): `best_match` picks one variant per
//!   block for the live plane count and the colour data is turned into the
//!   device form ([`fix_cicons`]). A pre-v11 blob declares no such arrays;
//!   its `G_CICON` objects (which the tool of the day zeroed) stay empty.
//! * **v13 (LP64) / v14 (ILP32)** — the same 84-byte header, but the image
//!   **begins with a native `RSHDR`**: the 18 LE `u16` of the classic
//!   header (`rsdefs.h:16-36` order), every offset counted from the image's
//!   first byte, padded to 40 bytes ([`RSHDR_PAD`]); the NRSC header sits
//!   at 40 and its offsets count from the first byte too. That is what an
//!   application finds behind `ap_rscmem` on EmuTOS — the loaded file,
//!   `RSHDR` at its head (`rs_readit`, `gemrslib.c:787`) — and what
//!   TeraDesk's own `xrsrc_gaddr` parses (`rsc_load.c:496-541`, on the
//!   AES-loaded `cicons.rsc`); with the NRSC header there instead it read
//!   `"NRSC"` + version as a pointer and faulted (A41 part 2,
//!   [`NRSC_VER_RSHDR`]). The preamble is checked against the NRSC header
//!   before the relocation ([`rshdr_is_consistent`]). A v1–v12 blob still
//!   has its header at 0 and loads unchanged.
//!
//! ```text
//!   [RSHDR: 18 × u16, classic order, padded to 40 B]               (v13+)
//!   NrscHeader: magic "NRSC", version, n_trees, n_objects,

//!                                                 char-grid words, else px)

//!   [ptr; n_frstr]   frstr table @ off_frstr    (v3+: offset → string data)
//!   [ptr; n_frimg]   frimg table @ off_frimg    (v3+: offset → a BITBLK)
//!   string / data bytes          (referenced by the ob_spec / table offsets)
//! ```
//!
//! Every offset — the `RSHDR`'s `u16` ones and the `NrscHeader`'s `u32` ones
//! alike — counts from the image's first byte, which is the `RSHDR` from
//! v13 on and the `NrscHeader` before; [`hdr`] finds the `NrscHeader` of a
//! validated image, so the preamble is accounted for in one place.
//!
//! The tree-index / frstr / frimg **slot** width matches `ob_spec`: 8 bytes
//! (LP64) or 4 bytes (ILP32), relocated at the calling app's ABI width like
//! the OBJECT array — the *file's* `version` only says which width its
//! producer wrote, the *caller's* ABI is what the loader relocates by.
//!
//! **Batch-1 scope:** the format, the relocation core
//! (`relocate_and_register`), `rsrc_gaddr`, `rsrc_obfix`, `rsrc_free`.
//! Loading from SD (`bdos::fs::read_file`), TEDINFO/ICONBLK/BITBLK
//! sub-pointer relocation, and `rsrc_saddr` are Batch 2.
//!
//! **What `rsrc_load` reports back (A35).** EmuTOS's `rs_readit` also reports
//! the load through the caller's `AESGLOBAL` — `ap_rscmem`, `ap_rsclen`
//! (`gemrslib.c:787-788`) and `ap_ptree` (`:595-597`) — and `rs_sglobe`
//! (`:675-679`) reads them back on every `rs_free`/`rs_gaddr`/`rs_saddr`.
//! NewTOS **writes** the three ([`report_load`]).
//!
//! **Where the descriptor lives (A39).** In EmuTOS those three words *are*
//! the descriptor, so the state is the application's and two AES processes
//! never touch each other's resource — the `AESPD` holds no resource field
//! (`aes/struct.h:119-155`), and `rs_load` frees nothing (`:786-788`), so a
//! process may hold several loaded blobs of which its `AESGLOBAL` names one.
//! NewTOS cannot read the state out of the application's memory (a blob is
//! reached through the kernel alias of the process window and needs the
//! ABI's record strides, [`Loaded`]), so it keeps its own descriptor —
//! **per AES process**, keyed by the caller's identity, in [`RSC`]: a list of the
//! process's loaded resources, **and the caller's `AESGLOBAL` says which one
//! a call acts on** — `rs_sglobe`'s binding (`:675-679`). `rsrc_load`
//! appends the new entry and names it through the caller's words
//! ([`report_load`]); `rsrc_free`/`rsrc_gaddr`/`rsrc_saddr` read the 4-byte
//! `ap_rscmem` back out of the caller's array and act on the entry of the
//! caller's own list it names ([`selected`]) — a value naming none of them
//! (0, another process's blob, a foreign or application-built address, a
//! null `global`) reads as "nothing loaded", because the kernel must not
//! parse a header it did not load; `appl_exit` touches nothing (`ap_exit`,
//! `aes/gemaplib.c:251-261`); at process end the process's entries go with
//! its memory ([`on_process_exit`], the counterpart of `ixterm` →
//! `free_all_owned`, `bdos/proc.c:136`). The model of the list is XaAES's
//! `client->resources` (`xaaes/src.km/xa_rsrc.c:895-900`), which stands in
//! for what EmuTOS gets from the application's own memory. That is the
//! whole of A39 (stage 1: the per-process list, `d7ab92d`; stage 2: the
//! selector read back, after A60 put TeraDesk's words at the TOS bytes,
//! `fc1bf02`). The contract is `docs/api/aes/resource-fileselector.md`
//! § `rsrc_load` (A39 callout, items 1–7); the reference comparison
//! `docs/analysis/rsrc-per-app-state-2026-09-19.md`.
//!
//! **A blob the four bytes cannot name.** `report_load` publishes only a
//! base that fits the field (below); a load it could not name — the
//! in-place kernel path, a pre-v7 blob without a tree table — leaves the
//! caller's `ap_rscmem` at 0, and 0 is then the name the entry answers to:
//! the zero selector reaches the process's latest such load and nothing
//! else. A named blob is never reached by 0, an unnamed one never by a
//! non-zero value. That keeps the A35 rule "the load itself still succeeds
//! and `rsrc_gaddr` still answers at full width" true for the one path that
//! has such loads (the host test harness; there is no EL1 caller on a
//! running system), without ever resolving a value the kernel did not
//! publish.
//!
//! Two things bound what can be written, and both are recorded at
//! [`report_load`]: the blob must carry a relocated tree table
//! ([`NRSC_VER_TRINDEX_PTR`]), and its base must fit the four bytes
//! `ap_ptree`/`ap_rscmem` have. The second excludes the in-kernel path, which
//! relocates in place in [`RSC_BUF`], a kernel high-half static — there the
//! three stay 0 rather than carry a truncated VA. That binds no caller on a
//! running system: **there is no EL1 caller of `rsrc_load`** (measured
//! 2026-09-13). Opcode 110 is reachable only through the `svc #2` dispatcher,
//! and of the four EL1 emitters only `kernel/src/selftest_objc.rs` issues rsrc
//! opcodes at all — its two functions that issue 110 have no caller, and
//! `run_rsrc`, reachable only from the callerless `aes_demo::showcase`,
//! registers its blob through `relocate_and_register` and never issues 110.
//! Traced in QEMU `raspi4b` (`--features aes-trace`): the then built-in
//! (EL1) desktop made 28 AES calls, all with `slot = 0xFF`, none of them rsrc; TeraDesk
//! made 188, all EL0, 68 of them rsrc, every blob address inside the process
//! window below 32 MiB then — and since ARCH03 stage 1 a pool address below
//! 2 GiB (plan invariant I2) — and so exact in four bytes.
//! **The one caller that does drive the EL1 load path is the host test
//! harness** `tests/aes_rsrc_global_fields.rs`, which is not a running system
//! — and on a 64-bit host no address is ever 32-bit representable, so that
//! harness can only ever observe the refusal, never the write.
//!
//! EmuTOS's own desktop is the counter-case — `load_icon_file`
//! (`desk/deskapp.c:554`) calls `rsrc_load` and reads `AP_1RESV` back (`:571`)
//! — and NewTOS's desktop, should it take that path, is an EL0 program
//! (`NEWDESK`) since DESK43 U9/U10, so its blob would lie in its own memory
//! like TeraDesk's. So the EL1 address question stays a
//! **conditional** constraint (`docs/api/aes/resource-fileselector.md`
//! §`rsrc_load`), not a blocker: it binds only if an EL1 caller is ever made
//! to load a resource itself.
//!
//! The tests stand in `tests/aes_rsrc_global_fields.rs`.

//
// EmuTOS `fix_tedinfo_std` (`aes/gemrslib.c:655-669`), called by `rs_readit`
// right after the offsets have become pointers (`gemrslib.c:798`):
//
//     if (fix_ptr(R_TEPTEXT,  ii)) ted->te_txtlen = strlen(ted->te_ptext)  + 1;
//     if (fix_ptr(R_TEPTMPLT, ii)) ted->te_tmplen = strlen(ted->te_ptmplt) + 1;
//
// The two *length* words are recomputed from the strings instead of trusted
// from the file. That is what keeps `te_txtlen` inside the bytes that actually
// sit behind `te_ptext`, because every writer bounds itself by `te_txtlen` and
// not by the buffer: `ins_char` (`object.rs`, EmuTOS `gemobed.c:117`) writes up
// to index `te_txtlen - 1`, and `inf_sset` (EmuTOS `util/optimize.c:103`) does
// `strlcpy(te_ptext, pstr, te_txtlen)`. A `te_txtlen` larger than the buffer is
// therefore a write past its end.
//
// Only the `rs_readit` path runs this. EmuTOS's *built-in* AES resource is
// initialised by `gem_rsc_init` (`aes/gem_rsc.c`), which deliberately does not:
// `erd` reserves the full `te_txtlen` bytes per TEDINFO in `rs_te_text[]`
// (`tools/erd.c:3007`, `te_ptext_len += get_short(&ted->te_txtlen)`), so the
// file's lengths are already correct there. [`relocate_blob`] — NewTOS's
// counterpart for the embedded GEM.RSC — is left alone to match.
//
// This is the one place NewTOS splits an EmuTOS function: EmuTOS's
// `fix_tedinfo_std` both relocates the three TEDINFO string pointers and
// recomputes the two length words, because only a loaded resource ever runs
// it. NewTOS's *embedded* GEM.RSC is a converted file too, so it still needs
// the pointer half — that half therefore lives in `relocate_blob_core`'s array
// walk, which both entry points run, while the length half stays here, which
// only `relocate_and_register` (the `rs_readit` path) runs. The observable
// split is EmuTOS's own.
//
// The walk goes over the TEDINFO array by the header's `n_ted`, exactly like
// `fix_tedinfo_std`'s `for (ii = 0; ii < rs_hdr->rsh_nted; ii++)`, so a record
// no object references is recomputed as well.

//
// EmuTOS `fix_cicons` (`aes/gemrslib.c:549-573`), run by `rs_readit` right
// after `fix_trindex` (`:795-797`): with the pointers of every CICONBLK and
// CICON in place, `transform_all_cicons` (`:403-477`) picks, per CICONBLK,
// the variant `best_match` (`:267-282`) selects for the live plane count
// `gl_nplanes`, stores it in `mainlist` (or NULL — the draw-time mono
// fallback), expands it to the device's plane count when it has fewer
// (`expand_cicondata`, `:284-343`), transforms the result to the device form
// (`transform_cicon`, `:348-396`) into a freshly allocated buffer, points
// `col_data` (and `sel_data`, in the second half of the same buffer) at it,
// and stamps `num_planes = gl_nplanes`, `next_res = NULL`.
//
// NewTOS has one device form: the 16-bit RGB565-chunky memory MFDB
// (`vdi/raster.rs` module docs, `CHUNKY_PLANES`) — the Falcon truecolor form
// EmuTOS's own `transform_cicon` produces when `planes > 8` (`:359-395`):
// `vr_trnfm` to chunky words with plane `p` at bit `15 - p` (our
// `vr_trnfm16` does the same, `raster.rs`), the top byte reversed into an
// index `n` 0..=255, and `n` resolved through the physical workstation's
// palette (`phys_work.ext->palette[n]`). That chain is a pure function of
// each pixel's plane bits, its mask bit and the palette, which is how
// [`cicon_pixel`] computes it — expansion and transform folded into one
// step per pixel, no intermediate standard-form buffer.
//
// One deviation is stated: EmuTOS allocates one buffer per icon and falls
// back to mono per icon when an allocation fails (`:436-449`). NewTOS makes
// **one** allocation per resource for all its icons. The reason was the
// per-process window's 32-entry block table (fewer than TeraDesk's 38
// icons); that table is gone since ARCH03 stage 1, so the deviation no
// longer has a cause and is a candidate for removal (not done in stage 1,
// which changes no AES behaviour). The fallback is therefore per resource: no buffer,
// no colour icon, the load itself still succeeds (§5.6 point 2's shape, at
// resource granularity). `rsrc_free` releases the one buffer
// (`free_cicon_buffers`, `:515-536`, walks EmuTOS's many).

    //!
    //! EmuTOS `rs_sglobe` (`aes/gemrslib.c:673-679`) re-reads `ap_rscmem` out
    //! of the caller's `AESGLOBAL` on every `rs_free`/`rs_gaddr`/`rs_saddr`,
    //! so an application that rewrites the word — TeraDesk's `load_icons`
    //! saves the `desktop.rsc` words, loads another blob, and restores them
    //! (`sdk/apps/teradesk/icon.c:2707-2708`, `:2762-2763`) — steers every
    //! later call back to the blob it names. The contract NewTOS implements
    //! is `docs/api/aes/resource-fileselector.md` § `rsrc_load`, A39 callout,
    //! items 3–5: the 4-byte selector is matched against the bases of the
    //! caller's **own** loaded blobs, and a value naming none of them (0,
    //! another process's blob, a foreign address, a null `global`) reads as
    //! "nothing loaded".
    //!
    //! These tests live in-crate for the same reason the A35 tests above do:
    //! a selector can only ever name a blob whose base fits four bytes, and
    //! on a 64-bit host only the access/target split of
    //! [`relocate_and_register_core`] — `load_into_user`'s shape — produces
    //! one. Each load here is exactly the dispatcher's `rsrc_load` tail after
    //! `read_file`: relocate at a user VA, [`register`] for the calling pid,
    //! [`report_load`] into the caller's `AESGLOBAL`. The calls under test
    //! (`rsrc_gaddr`, `rsrc_free`) go through the real dispatcher with the
    //! test's own persistent `AESGLOBAL`, as an application's would. Two
    //! processes are two claimed GEMDOS slots switched through `RUN`, as in
    //! `tests/aes_rsrc_per_process.rs`.

mod mfree_tests {
    //! A76 — **`Mfree(ap_rscmem)` is an ordinary free of an ordinary block.**
    //!
    //! The blob `rsrc_load` returns is a process-owned `Mxalloc` block like any
    //! other — EmuTOS's `rs_readit` takes it through `dos_alloc_anyram` =
    //! `Mxalloc(_, MX_PREFTTRAM)` (`aes/gemrslib.c:775`, `util/gemdos.c:117-120`)
    //! and stores its base in the caller's `ap_rscmem` (`:787`); nothing marks
    //! it as the AES's. A program's own `Mfree(ap_rscmem)` therefore succeeds
    //! (`bdos/umem.c:135-159`, `xmfree` — no ownership check), and only a
    //! *later* `rsrc_free` observes the double free: its `dos_free` fails and
    //! `rs_free` answers 0 (`gemrslib.c:685-708`). TeraDesk's `free_icons` →
    //! `xrsrc_free` = `Mfree(_AESrscmem)` (`sdk/apps/teradesk/rsc_load.c:
    //! 480-492`) is the caller; measured `Mfree(0x427000) -> -40` on the
    //! `cicons.rsc` blob (`TASK/A76.md`). Contract: `docs/api/gemdos/memory/
    //! 49-mfree.md` § "AES resource block", `docs/api/aes/resource-fileselector
    //! .md` A39 callout item 8, `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` "Resource-block
    //! ownership (A76)".
    //!
    //! ## Why in-crate, and what is real here
    //!
    //! Like [`super::selector_tests`], these need a blob whose base the four
    //! bytes of `ap_rscmem` can name — the EL0 shape of `load_into_user` — and
    //! an entry registered under a **pool key**. The pool is the real one: the
    //! block comes from `traps::mxalloc` on a BDOS pool installed for this
    //! binary, its address is the user address (VA = PA, ARCH03 stage 1), and
    //! `Mfree` goes through the GEMDOS trap entry (`gemdos::memory::mfree`)
    //! with the test's process as `RUN`, exactly the path an EL0 program
    //! takes. The only stand-in is the *access* alias: `load_into_user`
    //! reaches the block through its kernel alias, and the test pool's
    //! addresses are not host memory, so the blob bytes live in a buffer the
    //! test owns (the same split `relocate_and_register_core` gives the
    //! loader). Nothing about the accounting under test — the pool lists, the
    //! resource entry — is faked.
    //!
    //! The pool is a pure bookkeeping structure (its MDs live in a static
    //! arena, never inside the managed range), so a range of `Long` addresses
    //! that no one dereferences is a valid pool on the host. It is installed
    //! once for the whole binary; nothing else in these unit tests allocates
    //! from it.
