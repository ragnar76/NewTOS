/*
 * dumprast.c -- DUMPRAST, the VDI raster reference dumper (spec section 7).
 *
 * Portable.  The same source builds for the TT and for NewTOS; only the ABI
 * backend underneath differs.
 *
 * usage: DUMPRAST [CASES.TSV [OUT.BIN [OUT.LOG]]]
 *        defaults: RASTER.TSV in the current directory, RASTER.BIN and
 *        RASTER.LOG beside it.
 *
 * Why this is a separate program from DUMPVDI rather than more cases in its
 * table: the result of a raster call is MEMORY, not a number in INTOUT, so
 * the record has to carry two MFDBs and two pixel buffers, and the control
 * array has to be fifteen WORDs rather than twelve (an AArch64 caller packs
 * the second MFDB pointer at contrl[11..14]).  That is a different record,
 * and a different record is a different area -- which also means the VDI
 * dumps already taken keep comparing against their own table, unchanged.
 *
 * It does NOT wait for a keypress at the end, for the reason DUMPVDI does
 * not: the blocking console read never returns on a real Pi 4 (QUIRK-002).
 * The log file carries everything it printed, on both machines.
